/**
 * The admin desk.
 *
 * This file was 2606 lines and opened with a grid of twenty sync and debug
 * buttons, above a list of every market it could find. It called window.alert
 * a hundred times. Several of those buttons wrote to Base's V1, V2 or USDC
 * pool, and all three are owned by a key nobody has, so those writes could
 * never have landed. Meanwhile the one thing an operator has to do here,
 * register the markets people propose, had no button at all: the pending list
 * was computed on line 174 and never rendered, and the list it was computed
 * from had already been narrowed to `pred_v1_` and `pred_v2_` ids, which
 * excludes every market the current contract mints.
 *
 * What is left is four sections and five kinds of button. The bucketing lives in
 * adminMarkets.ts with a test on it, because a proposal in the wrong bucket is
 * a proposal nobody can see.
 *
 * Every chain write goes through useMarketWrite, which resolves the address
 * from the selected chain, re-checks at send time that it really is that
 * chain's market, moves the wallet onto the matching chain and pins chainId.
 * Nothing on this screen writes to an address it chose itself.
