/**
 * Daily tasks, rebuilt as a preview instead of a payout screen.
 *
 * What was here before read four functions off SwipeDailyRewards V3 with a
 * fallback to V2, plus a fifth off V1 to offer a migration, plus the $SWIPE
 * balance on Base. All of those contracts are archived and their owner key is
 * gone, so every number the old screen printed was either stale or zero and
 * every button on it opened a transaction that could not pay. The worst of it
 * was not the dead buttons, it was the figures: a streak, a "today's reward" of
 * 50,000, a 5% jackpot chance, a claimed total. A user reads those as theirs.
 *
 * So this file makes no network call and no contract read at all. It renders
 * the shape of the flow, says once that the shape is all it is, and shows no
 * quantity that could be mistaken for a balance, a streak or a promised reward.
 *
 * The numbers that do appear are the market contract's own rules, which are
 * live today and have nothing to do with the rewards contracts: the minimum
 * bet, the early-bet weighting, the creator fee and the early exit fee. The
 * collateral symbol comes from the selected chain rather than a literal,
 * because the minimum is 0.1 USDC on Base and 0.1 USDG on Robinhood.
 *
 * The one working control is the example toggle. A page of greyed-out rows
 * shows the layout but not the behaviour, and the behaviour is the part being
 * previewed. Turning it on fills the rows in and arms the claim buttons without
 * enabling them, and the note next to it says whose day it is not.
